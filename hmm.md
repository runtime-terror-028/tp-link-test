If you want the index page to load fresh every time the back button is pressed, effectively bypassing the browser cache, you can use a combination of techniques to achieve this. Here’s a basic outline:

### 1. **HTTP Headers**
You can control caching behavior on the server side by setting HTTP headers that instruct the browser not to cache the page. Here’s how you can do it:

- **No Cache Headers:** Add these headers to your server response to ensure that the page is not cached.

  ```http
  Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
  Pragma: no-cache
  Expires: 0
  ```

  These headers ensure that the browser does not cache the page and fetches a fresh copy every time.

### 2. **Meta Tags**
You can add meta tags in your HTML to discourage caching. These tags can be added to the `<head>` section of your HTML documents.

  ```html
  <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate">
  <meta http-equiv="Pragma" content="no-cache">
  <meta http-equiv="Expires" content="0">
  ```

  However, HTTP headers generally provide a more reliable approach.

### 3. **JavaScript Approach**
You can use JavaScript to force a reload of the page when navigating back. For instance, you can use the `beforeunload` event to clear cache when navigating away and ensure a fresh load.

  ```javascript
  window.onpageshow = function(event) {
    if (event.persisted) {
      // The page was loaded from the cache
      window.location.reload();
    }
  };
  ```

  This script will reload the page if it was loaded from the cache (when the `persisted` property is `true`).

### 4. **Avoiding Cache with URL Parameters**
A more straightforward method, though not always recommended for every use case, is to append a unique query parameter to the URL each time you visit the index page.

  ```javascript
  function loadIndexPage() {
    let timestamp = new Date().getTime();
    window.location.href = '/index.html?t=' + timestamp;
  }
  ```

  This forces the browser to treat each visit as a unique request, thus bypassing the cache.

### Summary
For a robust solution, especially if you have control over the server, setting proper HTTP headers is the best approach. You can complement it with JavaScript techniques if you need finer control or if you're working with a Single Page Application (SPA).
